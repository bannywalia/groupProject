# Artistry
Artistry is a music finding app that allows you to look up your favourite/new artist and get their top rated songs. Not only that, it even searches for any concerts/shows going on and gets you the ticket. This was a project made with HTML, CSS, Bulma, and JavaScript using two API's and making them co-exist together beautifully..

## The Two API's
* [Ticket Master] https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events.json?size=4&keyword=${keyword}&apikey=RF61BoAcPs2tAvFyC65f6PQ2k157lUEm - ticketmaster Api for tickets
* [Youtube Music](https://youtube-music1.p.rapidapi.com/v2/search?query=') - An API to get youtube music
